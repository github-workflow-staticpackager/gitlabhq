    The CI/CD [artifact report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html) type is deprecated in GitLab 16.9, and will be removed in GitLab 18.0. CI/CD configurations using this keyword will stop working in GitLab 18.0.

    The artifact report type is no longer used because of the removal of the legacy License Scanning CI/CD job in GitLab 16.3.
    Instead, you should use [License scanning of CycloneDX files](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/license_scanning_of_cyclonedx_files/).
