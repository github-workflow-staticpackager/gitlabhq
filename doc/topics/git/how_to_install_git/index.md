# Installing Git

To begin contributing to GitLab projects, you must download and install the Git client on your computer.

This page provides information on installing Git on the following operating systems:

- macOS
- Ubuntu Linux
- Microsoft Windows

For information on downloading and installing Git on other operating systems, see the
[official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Install and update Git on macOS

Though a version of Git is supplied by macOS, you should install the latest version of Git. A common way to
install Git is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index.html).

To install the latest version of Git on macOS with Homebrew:

1. If you've never installed Homebrew before, follow the
   [Homebrew installation instructions](https://brew.sh/index.html).
1. In a terminal, install Git by running `brew install git`.
1. Verify that Git works on your computer:

   ```shell
   git --version
   ```

Keep Git up to date by periodically running the following command:

```shell
brew update && brew upgrade git
```

## Install and update Git on Ubuntu Linux

Though a version of Git is supplied by Ubuntu, you should install the latest version of Git. The latest version is
available using a Personal Package Archive (PPA).

To install the latest version of Git on Ubuntu Linux with a PPA:

1. In a terminal, configure the required PPA, update the list of Ubuntu packages, and install `git`:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-add-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install git
   ```

1. Verify that Git works on your computer:

   ```shell
   git --version
   ```

Keep Git up to date by periodically running the following command:

```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git
```

## Install Git on Microsoft Windows

For information on downloading and installing Git on Microsoft Windows, see the
[official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

## After you install Git

After you successfully install Git on your computer, read about [adding an SSH key to GitLab](../../../user/ssh.md).
